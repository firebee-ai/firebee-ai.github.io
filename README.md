    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I dont think so my journey is inspring. but whatever i did i think is worth shareble. no doubt I am a failed Aerospace Engineer yet i have done 
      advanced courses but still i dont consider myself as true aerospace Engineer. I lost all hope projects. I was drowning. My cgpa was decreasing. 
      I had suicidal thoughts or destructive thoughts. I was trying to get rid of everything and restart. all day i used to think about these negative things.
      darkness everywhere. thoughts to end everything.
      And now I am here writing everything on my own website that i made myself. A bayeian Statistian, Data Enthusiast Web And Soft developer.
